# Hi! I'm B.T.

I'm a passionate software developer and entrepreneur specializing in AI-driven applications. With over two decades of experience in the tech industry, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from game development to generative art and music. My focus is on creating innovative, engaging, and meaningful experiences that push the boundaries of technology and delight users. I'm driven by a constant curiosity and a deep desire to make a positive impact on the world through my work.

Currently, I'm working remotely at Zilliant where I help to guide the technological future of the company by providing vision and direction for the design of our systems. In addition to my full-time work, I'm also an independent researcher, focusing on the development of software to explore computational creativity and artificial intelligence. I have presented at international conferences and have published several papers on the subject.
