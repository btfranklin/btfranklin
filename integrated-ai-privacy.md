# Privacy Policy

Our Xcode Source Editor Extension, Integrated AI, does not collect any personal data from users. It does not access or transmit any information about the user or their device. The extension simply allows users to make calls to GPT-3's "edit" endpoint while editing their Swift files, and does not collect or transmit any data as part of this process.

The extension may transmit data to the GPT-3 service as part of its functionality. Any data transmitted to or from the GPT-3 service is subject to the privacy policies of OpenAI, the provider of the GPT-3 service. We do not have access to or control over the data transmitted to or from the GPT-3 service, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of OpenAI.

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users and their data. If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us at <brandon.franklin@gmail.com>.
