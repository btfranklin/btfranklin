Hi!  I'm B.T. Franklin, and I'm a software architect and computational creativity researcher based in Phoenix, Arizona. With over 30 years of experience as a software engineer and architect, I have a strong background in UI/UX design and implementation.

Currently, I'm working remotely at Zilliant where I help to guide the technological future of the company by providing vision and direction for the design of our systems. In addition to my full-time work, I'm also an independent researcher, focusing on the development of software to explore computational creativity and artificial intelligence. I have presented at international conferences and have published several papers on the subject.

My professional skills include software engineering, user interface design, and agile methodologies. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and finding ways to apply them in my work. In my career, I hope to continue making a positive impact through my work in software architecture and computational creativity.
